# Simple Todo App

## This app is created using React for an interview project

### Development Environment enhancements
I have used Webpack Hot Module Replacement for faster development. And ESlint for linting with `eslint-plugin-react`. For further enchancements I thought of migrating the project to TypeScript, which would make the app less prone to bugs and more predictable. There did not seem any need for state management such as Redux, hence I did not use it in the app. 

### UI Enchancement 
I have used Material UI Components.
